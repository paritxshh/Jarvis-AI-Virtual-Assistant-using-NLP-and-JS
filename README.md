This virtual assistant, inspired by the famous AI assistant from Iron Man, aims to provide users with a conversational interface for performing various tasks. It is a master javascript project that uses the JavaScript advance concept with the feature of converting text to speech and then using the Natural Language Processing method to help understand jarvis, what the client is asking for, and then providing the web search result to the user.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Utilizes advanced NLP algorithms to understand user queries and commands in natural language.
- **Voice Interaction:** Supports voice input and output, allowing users to interact with the assistant hands-free.
- **Task Automation:** Performs tasks such as setting reminders, sending emails, retrieving information from the web, and more, based on user commands.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily add new features and integrations.
